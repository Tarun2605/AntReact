It provides the necessary heat and light for life on Earth. The Sun is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion generating a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It has a complex structure with several layers including the core, radiative zone, and convective zone. Solar activity, such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, affects space weather and can impact Earth's magnetosphere."
